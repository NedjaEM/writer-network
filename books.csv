Judgment Day,يوم الدين,"Brought up in poverty in a remote part of an unstable Arab republic, the narrator studies Islamic law and Arabic and becomes a cleric and civil servant in the capital. At the age of almost 40 he accepts a position as imam of a mosque serving his compatriots in a richer and more cosmopolitan neighboring Arab country. His humdrum life changes when an educated and independent woman recruits him as consultant for a book on the great tenth-century Arab poet al- Mutanabbi. As their work together on his poetry leads to friendship and then love, the imam becomes embroiled in ideological conflict with activist Islamists at his mosque. Taken into protective custody after his enemies declare him apostate, and separated from the woman he loves, the imam chronicles how their relationship opened his eyes to a new world and taught him to overcome his old inhibitions. Judgment Day touches on debates within contemporary Islam and on the transformative and humanizing power of love between men and women.",Rasha al-Ameer,Jonathan Wright,American University at Cairo,2002,2012,Male,Lebanon,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/translation/search/index.html?record=114,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KCb4xFJeL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2873198357/ca84bb89396fa12275b8b010e3e8f655_400x400.jpeg,fiction,,,,

Dove's Necklace,طوق الحمام,"When the body of a young woman is discovered in the Lane of Many Heads, an alley in modern-day Mecca, no one will claim it, as they are all ashamed of her nakedness. As Detective Nasser pursues his investigation of the case, seemingly all of Mecca chimes in―including the Lane of Many Heads itself―in this brilliant, funny, profane, and enigmatic fever dream of a novel by Raja Alem, the first woman to win the International Prize for Arabic Fiction. Nasser initially suspects that the dead woman is Aisha, one of the residents of the Area, and he searches her emails for clues. The world she paints embraces everything from crime and religious extremism to the exploitation of foreign workers by a mafia of building contractors, who are destroying the historic areas of the city. In stark relief with this grimness is the beauty of her love letters to her German boyfriend. Another view reveals the city through the eyes of Yusuf, Aisha's neighbor, increasingly frustrated by the acceleration pace of change. As gripping as classic noir, nuanced as a Nabokov novel, and labyrinthine as the alleys of Mecca itself, this powerful and disturbing work of fiction masterfully reveals a city and a civilization in all its contradictions, at once beholden to brutal customs and uneasily coming to terms with new traditions. Raja Alem's singular The Dove's Necklace is a virtuosic work of literature that deserves the world's attention.",Raja Alem,Katharine Halls,Overlook,2010,2013,Female,Saudi Arabia,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/translation/search/index.html?record=163,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z7SaYaiDL.jpg,http://t1.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHFdEnZbvBMCUZNiJjV7AoN-F54Mtkwf00-gkqhgqct8nnsfzZi6KiYa-mK_Ow,fiction,,,,
Days of Ignorance,جاهلية,"Is he dead?

Medina, Saudi Arabia. A young man, Malek, has been brutally attacked for being of the ‘wrong’ race.

Malek’s lover, Leen, waits by his bedside and reflects on their relationship and her life as an unmarried, childless woman. All around her are voices of judgment and concern; in the twenty-first century it is still unforgivable, and dangerous, for a Saudi woman to enter into a relationship with a black man. In the distance US planes hover over Iraq, primed to embark on yet another senseless conflict.

Malek’s attacker was Leen’s brother.

Flinging wide a window onto the second holiest Islamic city--a city in which people observe daily prayers and preach equality and justice--Days of Ignorance is a novel about honor, hypocrisy, war and fear.

Hend and the Soldiers,هند والعسكر,"Hend is a young Saudi Arabian woman struggling to challenge her conservative society, which is represented by various soldiers, real and metaphorical, in her life. After a failed arranged marriage to an army officer, she is determined to establish herself as a writer and make her own choices in love. Her mother, a firm supporter of their society's traditional norms, works to block her efforts. As Hend engages with her mother, stories of her past and those of other female relatives reveal the extent of the suffering previous generations of women have endured while living in such a patriarchal society. Hend also comes to understand how such traditions have adversely affected the men in her family, including one brother who flees to the West and another who finds comradeship among the members of al-Qaeda.",Badriah Albeshr,Sanna Dhahir,University of Texas,2006,2017,Female,Saudi Arabia,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/translation/search/index.html?record=160,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41a2lmNKDpL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg",https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-11/badriyah-al-bishr-twitter_650x400_41509674760.jpg,fiction,,,,
The Stone of Laughter,حجر الضحك,"This is the story of a person. It is also a story of a population, and of a war. It reads as grotesque fantasy, where traditional assumptions can be fatal, consequences no longer make sense and the most commonplace social act may conceal lethal betrayal. In 14 years of civil war, which left Beirut's glories ravished and its cosmopolitan society devastated, the grotesque becomes mundane. Disoriented amid the chaos, Khalil questions his every thought and impulse as he grasps for an identity, sexuality and teleology-his internal dialogue is the warp of this narrative. Retreating into desperate isolation when the two men he covertly loves are killed, Khalil is paralyzed by guilt and fear. His despair brings illness and a minor epiphany in the hospital, where he awakens, in the book's most impressionistic and fluidly crafted sequence, to the value and beauty of life. Barakat allows Khalil this illumination, a lambent moment of hope, so that she may quickly shatter it. Khalil's dizzying descent to an inhumanity as perverse and cruel as it is mad, seems incomprehensible. Khalil's tormented mind, his betrayal of newly discovered selfhood reflects the unendurable stress provoked by such war. The frightening results, and the fragility of civilization, is the kernel of this cautionary tale, told too late for young men like Khalil.",Hoda Barakat,Sophie Bennet,Interlink Publishing Group,1990,1995,Female,Lebanon,https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56656-190-7,,,fiction,,,,

Blue Lorries,فرج,"Nada is no stranger to protest. She is five years old when her French mother takes her to visit her Egyptian father, a political activist with a passing resemblance to President Nasser, in prison. When he returns home five years later, a changed man, their little family begins to fracture and eventually Nada's mother moves back to Paris. Through her teenage years Nada is surrounded by the language of protest – 'anarchism', 'Trotskyism', 'communism' – and, one summer in Paris, she discovers the '68 movement and her first love. And how to slam doors in anger. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Through student sit-ins, imprisonments, passionate arguments, accidental alliances, fallen friends, joys and regrets, Nada's story grows into the story of Egypt's many celebrated activists such as Arwa and Siham.

Spectres,أطياف,"The fates of two Egyptian women who grew up during the turbulent, nationalistic 1950s and participated in the revolutionary student movement of the early 1970s intertwine in Ashour's meandering autobiographical novel. The narrator, ostensibly the author ""Radwa,"" born in 1946, returns to the time of her youth in Cairo, first in French grade school, then at Cairo University in the mid-1960s, by employing the parallel--and often intersecting--life of her character Shagar Abdel Ghaffar, a young woman born on the same day and year who attends the university as a history student and eventually becomes a professor. Shagar writes a book about the Israeli massacre at the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin that becomes the focus of Radwa's own research interest, which took the shape of Ashour's actual novel, Granada. The author draws pointed lessons from the defense of truth and intellectual freedom that Shagar stands for, though only American readers versed in recent Egyptian history will appreciate the nuances",Radwa Ashour,Barbara Romaine,Interlink Publishing Group,1999,2010,woman,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/5598805,https://productimages.worldofbooks.com/1906697256.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1274768270p8/1424397.jpg,fiction,USA,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1226426626l/5598805.jpg,,
Woman from Tantoura,الطنطورية,"Palestine. For most of us, the word brings to mind a series of confused images and disjointed associations—massacres, refugee camps, UN resolutions, settlements, terrorist attacks, war, occupation, checkered kuffiyehs and suicide bombers, a seemingly endless cycle of death and destruction. This novel does not shy away from such painful images, but it is first and foremost a powerful human story, following the life of a young girl from her days in the village of al-Tantoura in Palestine up to the dawn of the new century. We participate in events as they unfold, seeing them through the uneducated but sharply intelligent mind of Ruqayya, as she tries to make sense of all that has happened to her and her family. With her, we live her love of her land and of her people; we feel the repeated pain of loss, of diaspora, and of cross-generational misunderstanding; and above all, we come to know her indomitable human spirit. As we read we discover that we have become part of Ruqayya’s family, and her voice will remain with us long after we have closed the book.",Radwa Ashour,Kay Heikkinen,The American University in Cairo Press,2010,2014,woman,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/fr/book/show/27269009-the-woman-from-tantoura,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445722601l/27269009._SY475_.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1274768270p8/1424397.jpg,political fiction,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314481218l/8239301.jpg,,
Queue,الطابور,"In a surreal, but familiar, vision of modern day Egypt, a centralized authority known as ‘the Gate’ has risen to power in the aftermath of the ‘Disgraceful Events,’ a failed popular uprising. Citizens are required to obtain permission from the Gate in order to take care of even the most basic of their daily affairs, yet the Gate never opens, and the queue in front of it grows longer.
 
 Citizens from all walks of life mix and wait in the sun: a revolutionary journalist, a sheikh, a poor woman concerned for her daughter’s health, and even the brother of a security officer killed in clashes with protestors. Among them is Yehia, a man who was shot during the Events and is waiting for permission from the Gate to remove a bullet that remains lodged in his pelvis. Yehia’s health steadily declines, yet at every turn, officials refuse to assist him, actively denying the very existence of the bullet.
 
 Ultimately it is Tarek, the principled doctor tending to Yehia’s case, who must decide whether to follow protocol as he has always done, or to disobey the law and risk his career to operate on Yehia and save his life.
 
 Written with dark, subtle humor, The Queue describes the sinister nature of authoritarianism, and illuminates the way that absolute authority manipulates information, mobilizes others in service to it, and fails to uphold the rights of even those faithful to it.",Basma Abdel Aziz,Elisabeth Jaquette,Melville House Publishing,2013,2016,woman,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186905-the-queue,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1598020325l/30186905._SX318_.jpg,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/aziz.jpg,satire,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1360418585l/17343089.jpg,,

Pistachio Seller,بائع الفستق,"""It was Saturday. I remember. And while he was standing on a step ladder in the hall, changing a light bulb in the faint light coming through the window, I decided to love him."" So begins this wonderfully exuberant novel of quixotic adolescent longing and the enduring search for self. Set in middle class urban Egypt, the story chronicles young Wafaa’s struggle to come to terms with her own sexuality and her romantic infatuation with her cousin Ashraf, a spoiled and confident young Egyptian who was educated in England. Ashraf’s worldliness and carefree attitudes stand in sharp contrast to Wafaa’s provincial Islamic piousness. As both mature they find outside events encroaching upon their sheltered lives, forcing each to confront challenges to their youthful ideologies.

Ali and his Russian Mother,علي وأمه الروسية,"A fresh, daring voice in arabic literature today. Alexandra Chreiteh’s Ali and his Russian Mother is at once an ordinary and extraordinary story of two young people in Lebanon. At the outbreak of the July War in 2006, the novel’s unnamed young protagonist reconnects with her childhood friend and develops a little crush on him, as they flee the bombs unleashed upon their country by Israel. Displaced, along with a million others across the country, she and her Russian mother have joined an evacuation for Russian citizens, when she again meets up with Ali, her former schoolmate from the South, who also has a Russian (Ukrainian) mother. As the two friends reunite, chat, and bond during a harrowing bus caravan across the Syrian border to Lattakia, en route to Moscow, Chreiteh’s unique, comic sense of the absurd speaks to contradictions faced by a young generation in Lebanon now, sounding out taboos surrounding gender, sexual, religious, and national identities. Carrying Russian passports like their mothers—both of whom married Lebanese men and settled there—they are forced to reflect upon their choices, and lack of them, in a country that is yet again being torn apart by violent conflict. Like Chreiteh’s acclaimed first novel, Always Coca-Cola, this story employs deceptively simple language and style to push the boundaries of what can be talked about in Arabic fiction. Again focused on the preoccupations of young people and their hopes for the future, Ali and his Russian Mother represents a fresh, daring voice in Arabic literature today.",Alexandra Chreiteh,Michelle Hartman,Interlink Books,2009,2015,woman,Lebanon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26510168-ali-and-his-russian-mother,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367547454l/8264785.jpg,https://ase.tufts.edu/ilcs/images/facultyChreiteh.jpg,finction,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367547454l/8264785.jpg,,

Rain Over Baghdad,مطر على بغداد,"What was it like to live in Iraq before the earth-shaking events of the end of the twentieth century? The mid seventies to the late eighties witnessed Saddam Hussein's rise to power, the establishment of Kurdish autonomy in the north, and the Iraq-Iran war. It also brought an influx of oil wealth, following the 1973 war and the spike in oil prices, and a parallel influx of Arab talent, including many Egyptians, as the Egyptian left became disenchanted with Sadat. The massive migration also extended to workers and peasants, some of whom created an entire Egyptian village just outside Baghdad. We witness all of this and more through the eyes of an Egyptian woman married to an engineer working in Iraq. The narrator, who works for an Egyptian magazine's bureau in the Iraqi capital, has a behind-the-scenes view of what was really happening at a critical juncture in the history of the region. Moreover, she has a mystery to solve: an Iraqi woman from the marshes in the south of Iraq, who is also a communist journalist, has disappeared, and as the mystery unfolds we learn of her love for an older Egyptian Marxist journalist. This is Iraq before and beyond Saddam, Iraq as the Arabs knew it, in the lives of interesting people living in a vibrant country before the attempted annexation of Kuwait and the American invasion. This is the Iraq that was",Hala El Badry,Farouk Abd Al Wahab,American University in Cairo Press,2010,2014,male,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17678411-rain-over-baghdad,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367224698l/17678411.jpg,https://aucpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HalaElBadry.jpg,,Egypt,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432909138l/25625215._SX318_.jpg,,

Zubaida's Window,ممرات السكون,"In the first novel in English by an Iraqi to focus on the 2003 invasion, Iqbal Al-Qazwini masterfully describes the tortured psyche of a woman who fled Iraq but still longs for her homeland. Like millions around the world, Iraqi exile Zubaida watches the invasion on her television. As she sits in her apartment in Berlin, the unreal and constantly flickering images of US forces closing in on Baghdad are her only connection to the war a world away. But unlike most viewers, she can remember the city of her childhood, where memories of her loving grandmother and of attending movies with her father mix with nightmarish images of hangings in Al-Tahrir Square. Struggling to deal with the horror on the television and the ghosts of her memory, Zubaida, in her grief, creates her own world, one in which she can almost go home. Haunting and lyrical, Zubaida’s Window reveals the individual costs of war and the resilience of those who live through it.Haunting and lyrical, Zubaida’s Window reveals the individual costs of war and the resilience of those who live through it.",Iqbal Al Qazwini,Azza El-Kholy; Amira Nowaira;,Feminist Press,2006,2008,Female,Iraq,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/translation/search/index.html,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1354209769l/3065015.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1465387589p5/1312892.jpg,Fiction,,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=XzljAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73u6ejsemUTwbfvfKiY3i66Evy4TLgA6w1xAd9QQH76Gb6PjP10nXVfKwMj-eyzRnwxn-k_hYXtMkkgYR6uNPuKfLXSFr0L1OTVLlsUDUbc8oNJGPXF3Dd1n1Q0xlrLlyL9uUwx,,

Cancelled Memories,الذكريات الملغاة,"Set during the Lebanese civil war, this novel chronicles the splintering of the Al-Mukhtars, a Lebanese family whose love and trust for one another is strained by the increasing economic, social, and psychological tensions that surround them. Huda, feeling helpless as a housewife, pursues a career as a university professor and immerses herself in her work and students. Sharif, trapped in a static bureaucratic position, begins to resent his wife’s success and slowly withdraws from his family. When their marriage dissolves, the couple fight over the custody of their adolescent daughter. In a patriarchal society that favors the rights of the father, Huda is powerless as her daughter is taken from her. Through the author’s use of flashbacks, the reader witnesses the stark contrast between the young, idealistic couple and the older husband and wife, who have become increasingly isolated and disillusioned. Narrated through the voices of several characters, Canceled Memories depicts a Lebanese family seeking to maintain love and trust for each other despite the destructive and corrupting effects of war.

All that I want to Forget,,"Fatima loves poetry and wants to study French literature—both of which are anathema to her strict and conservative much older brother, Saqr. While living under his roof, Fatima’s hopes and dreams are scrutinized, mocked, and slowly crushed as she is forced into his narrow vision of the right path.
 
 Then Fatima meets Isam, a poet like her; they email love letters to each other and meet in secret. Saqr, however, has other ideas: she is married off to Faris, a complete stranger. He is not the cruel tyrant her brother was, but still she did not choose him.
 
 Will she escape her past to live the life of love and poetry she craves?",Bothayna Al-Essa,Michele Henjum,Hoopoe,,2019,Female,Kuwait,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/translation/search/index.html,https://hoopoefiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/4169083-652x1024.jpg,,Fiction,,,,
Sarab,كبرتُ ونسيت أن أنسى,"November 1979. Violence has broken out in the holiest site of Islam after a charismatic rebel and his devoted followers have announced the coming of the Mahdi and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Among the insurgents is a young woman, Sarab, disguised as a man. As the horror and chaos of the siege reach their peak, she escapes and encounters a French officer from the opposing side.

Revolt Against the Sun,,"The Iraqi poet Nazik al-Mala’ika was one of the most important Arab poets of the twentieth century. Over the course of a four-decade career, her contributions to both the theory and the practice of free verse (or tafʿilah) poetry confirmed her position as a pioneer of Arab modernism. Revolt Against the Sun presents a selection of Nazik al-Mala’ika’s poetry in English for the first time. Bringing together poems from each of her published collections, it traces al-Mala’ika’s transformation from a lyrical Romantic poet in the 1940s to a fervently committed Arab nationalist in the 1970s and 1980s. The translations offer both an overview of her life and work, and an insight into the political and social realities in the Arab world in the decades following the Second World War. Featuring a comprehensive historical and critical introduction, this bilingual reader reveals how one woman transformed the landscape of modern Arabic literature and culture in the twentieth century. It is a key resource for students and teachers of Arabic and world literature, as well as for readers interested in discovering an alternative narrative of modern Iraqi culture.",Nazik al-Mala'ika,Emily Drumstra,Saqi,,2020,Female,Iraq,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/translation/search/index.html,https://17osyg1teaul3pgmn313mq15-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Revolt-Against-the-Sun_front-cover-pdf.jpg,,Poetry,,,https://arablit.org/2020/10/10/bulaq-57-revolt-against-the-sun/,

The Hidden Face of Eve,الوجه العاري للمرأة العربية,"This powerful account of brutality against women in the Muslim world remains as shocking today as when it was first published, more than a quarter of a century ago. It was the horrific female genital mutilation that she suffered aged only six, which first awakened Nawal el Saadawi's sense of the violence and injustice which permeated her society. Her experiences working as a doctor in villages around Egypt, witnessing prostitution, honour killings and sexual abuse, inspired her to write in order to give voice to this suffering. She goes on explore the causes of the situation through a discussion of the historical role of Arab women in religion and literature.Saadawi argues that the veil, polygamy and legal inequality are incompatible with the just and peaceful Islam which she envisages.",Nawal El Saadawi,Sherif Hetata,Beacon Press,1977,1983,Male,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23274854-the-hidden-face-of-eve,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411777830l/23274854.jpg,,,Egypt,,Multiple translations,
"The Image, The Icon, and the Covenant",صورة وأيقونة وعهد قديم,"After abandoning his beloved Mariam when she falls pregnant, and escaping her brothers' bullets, Ibrahim abandons his own ideals and dreams of becoming a novelist, opting instead to follow his father's wishes and seek wealth and commercial success abroad. Thirty years later, lonely and disillusioned, Ibrahim returns to Ramallah to retrace the past he tried to leave behind. He sets out on a long and frustrating quest to track down Mariam, which takes him from the West Bank to Israel. Along the way he encounters his son, Michael, a young man with spiritual powers that enable him to see what is unknown and find what has gone missing.


Moving and lyrical, Khalifeh's novel weaves religious and political symbolism into a story of love and loss. At its core is Ibrahim's- the Palestinian's- agonizing but unrelenting search for a home.

In the House of Silence,,"To complement the novels in the ""Arab Women Writers"" series, this is a collection of autobiographical writings by 13 leading Arab women authors. Through these testimonies, the women describe their experiences and expose the often difficult conditions under which their narratives were written. Patterns running throughout include experiences of confinement, subjugation, the struggle for education and the eventual use of writing as an escape. They speak of their own reasons for writing, of how experiences in family life, politics, exile and even imprisonment have affected them and their work, and of how their motivation has been both tested and reinforced by various setbacks and the struggle for recognition.",Fadia Faqir,,Garnet Publishing,,2014,,Jordan,,https://www.garnetpublishing.co.uk/app/uploads/2015/11/house.jpg,,autobiography,,,,
Chaos of the Senses,فوضى الحواس,"Love always sits in a seat other than the one we were expecting it to, right alongside the place where we expected love to be' In the midst of the Algerian civil war, Hayat is a young novelist trapped in a loveless marriage. While her husband, a high-ranking officer, preoccupies himself with politics, Hayat finds freedom from her highly regimented life in the world of her writing. There she weaves a passionate story for her characters. But the line between fiction and reality blurs when she falls for a man who seems to have walked straight out of the pages of her notebook, a man who seduces her, instead of her heroine, with his silence. As love on paper becomes a forbidden love lived out in the dark corners of a broken city, Hayat's country convulses with political upheaval. In a place where those who dare to write the truth are made to pay a heavy price, she and her characters will discover that no one can truly be the author of their own destiny.

Granada,ثلاثية غرناطة,"Radwa Ashour skillfully weaves a history of Granadan rule and an Arabic world into a novel that evokes cultural loss and the disappearance of a vanquished population. The novel follows the family of Abu Jaafar, the bookbinder, his wife, widowed daughter-in-law, her two children, and his two apprentices as they witness Christopher Columbus and his entourage in a triumphant parade featuring exotic plants and animals and human captives from the New World. Embedded in the narrative is the preparation for the marriage of Saad, one of the apprentices, and Saleema, Abu Jaafar's granddaughter -- a scenario that is elegantly revealed in a number of parallel scenes.

As the new rulers of Granada confiscate books and officials burn the collected volumes, Abu Jaafur quietly moves his rich library out of town. Persecuted Muslims fight to form an independent government, but increasing economic and cultural pressures on the Arabs of Spain and Christian rulers culminate in Christian conversions and Muslim uprisings.

A tale that is both vigorous and heartbreaking, this novel will appeal to general readers of Spanish and Arabic literature as well as anyone interested in Christian-Muslim relations.",Radwa Ashour,William Granara,Syracuse University Press,1998,2003,Male,Egypt,https://press.syr.edu/supressbooks/506/granada/,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925554l/218562.jpg,,Fiction,USA,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1290146452l/9730311.jpg,,
The Sea Cloak and Other Stories,عباءة بحر وقصص أخرى,"The Sea Cloak is a collection of 11 stories by the author, journalist, and women’s rights campaigner, Nayrouz Qarmout. Drawing from her own experiences growing up in a Syrian refugee camp, as well as her current life in Gaza, these stories stitch together a patchwork of different perspectives into what it means to be a woman in Palestine today.

Whether following the daily struggles of orphaned children fighting to survive in the rubble of recent bombardments, or mapping the complex, cultural tensions between different generations of refugees in wider Gazan society, these stories offer rare insights into one of the most talked about, but least understood cities in the Middle East. Taken together, the collection affords us a local perspective on a global story, and it does so thanks to a cast of (predominantly female) characters whose vantage point is rooted, firmly, in that most cherished of things, the home.

Trees for The Absentees,أشجار للناس الغائبين,"Young love, meddling relatives, heart-to-hearts with friends real and imagined – Philistia’s world is that of an ordinary university student, except that in occupied Palestine, and when your father is in indefinite detention, nothing is straightforward.

Philistia is closest to her childhood, and to her late grandmother and her imprisoned father, when she’s at her part-time job washing women’s bodies at the ancient Ottoman hammam in Nablus, the West Bank. A midwife and corpse washer in her time, Grandma Zahia taught Philistia the ritual ablutions and the secrets of the body: the secrets of life and death.

On the brink of adulthood, Philistia embarks on a journey through her country’s history – a magical journey, and one of loss and centuries of occupation.

As trees are uprooted around her, Philistia searches for a place of refuge, a place where she can plant a memory for the ones she’s lost.",Ahlam Bsharat,"Ruth Ahmedzai Kemp, Sue Copeland",Neem Tree Press,2013,2019,Female,Palestine,https://neemtreepress.com/book/trees-for-the-absentees/,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565982297l/51995019._SX318_SY475_.jpg,,Historical Fiction,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371124646l/18071759.jpg,,
Girls of Riyadh,بنات الرياض,"The novel describes the relationship between men and women in Saudi Arabia. Girls of Riyadh tells the story of four college-age high class friends in Saudi Arabia, girls looking for love but stymied by a system that allows them only limited freedoms and has very specific expectations and demands. There's little contact between men and women—especially single teens and adults—but modern technology has changed that a bit (leading to young men trying everything to get women to take down their cellphone numbers). The Internet is also a new medium that can't contain women and their thoughts like the old system could, and the anonymous narrator of the novel takes advantage of that: she presents her stories in the form of e-mails that she sends out weekly to any Saudi address she can find. Sex is described in this novel and the various ways it is thought of before and after marriage. Engaging in pre marital sex in the novel has negative consequences for some of the characters who face rejection as a result. The novel also features instances of arranged and failed marriages and discusses the gamble a Saudi women takes when entering into one.

I want to get married,عايزة أتجوز,"The rules may differ from country to country, but the dating game is a universal constant. After years of searching for Mr. Right in living-room meetings arranged by family or friends, Ghada Abdel Aal, a young Egyptian professional, decided to take to the blogosphere to share her experiences and vent her frustrations at being young, single, and female in Egypt. Her blog, I Want to Get Married!, quickly became a hit with both men and women in the Arab world. With a keen sense of humor and biting social commentary, Abdel Aal recounts in painful detail her adventures with failed proposals and unacceptable suitors. There’s Mr. Precious, who storms out during their first meeting when he feels his favorite athlete has been slighted, and another suitor who robs her in broad daylight, to name just a few of the characters she runs across in her pursuit of wedded bliss. I Want to Get Married! has since become a best-selling book in Egypt and the inspiration for a television series. This witty look at dating challenges skewed representations of the Middle East and presents a realistic picture of what it means to be a single young woman in the Arab world, where, like elsewhere, a good man can be hard to find.

Distant View of a Minaret,بعيداً عن المئذنة,"“More convincingly than any other woman writing in Arabic today, Alifa Rifaat lifts the veil on what it means to be a woman living within a traditional Muslim society.” So states the translator’s foreword to this collection of the Egyptian author’s best short stories. Rifaat (1930-1996) did not go to university, spoke only Arabic, and seldom traveled abroad. This virtual immunity from Western influence lends a special authenticity to her direct yet sincere accounts of death, sexual fulfillment, the lives of women in purdah, and the frustrations of everyday life in a male-dominated Islamic environment. Translated from the Arabic by Denys Johnson-Davies, the collection admits the reader into a hidden private world, regulated by the call of the mosque, but often full of profound anguish and personal isolation. Badriyya’s despairing anger at her deceitful husband, for example, or the haunting melancholy of “At the Time of the Jasmine,” are treated with a sensitivity to the discipline and order of Islam.",Alifa Rifaat,Denys Johnson-Davies,Heinemann,1983,1987,male,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206228.Distant_View_of_a_Minaret_and_Other_Stories,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172679166l/206228.jpg,,,Canada,,,
A man from Bashmour,البشموري,"Egypt in the ninth century ad: an Arab, Muslim ruling class governs a country of mostly Coptic-speaking Christians. After an exorbitant land tax imposed by the caliph's governors sparks a peasant revolt, Budayr is dispatched to the marshlands of the Nile Delta as an escort for a church-appointed emissary whose mission is to persuade the rebels to lay down their arms. But he is soon caught up in a swirl of events and concerns that alter the course of his life irrevocably, setting him on a path he could never have foreseen. The events that befall him and the insights he gains from them bring about a gradual but inexorable personal transformation, through which his eyes are opened to the fundamental commonalities practical, spiritual, and existential that bind Muslims and Copts, and he emerges as an emissary of a new sort. Hailed as a groundbreaking treatment of otherwise neglected aspects of medieval history, The Man from Bashmour is an exploration of the Egyptian character past and present, and offers insights into Egyptian thought on everything from love, philosophy, and religion to life and death.",Salwa Bakr,Nancy Roberts,American University in Cairo Press,1998,2007,female,Egypt,https://aucpress.com/product/the-man-from-bashmour/,,,Fiction,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391364064l/18081744.jpg,,
Napthalene,حبات النفتالين,"Seen through the eyes of a strong-willed and perceptive young girl, Naphtalene beautifully captures the atmosphere of Baghdad in the 1940s and 1950s. Through her rich and lyrical descriptions, Alia Mamdouh vividly recreates a city of public steam baths, roadside butchers, and childhood games played in the same streets where political demonstrations against British colonialism are beginning to take place.

At the heart of the novel is nine-year-old Huda, a girl whose fiery, defiant nature contrasts sharply with her own inherent powerlessness. Through Mamdouh's strikingly inventive use of language, Huda's stream-of-consciousness narrative expands to take in the life not only of a young girl and her family, but of her street, her neighborhood, and her country. Alia Mamdouh, winner of the Naguib Mahfouz Award in Arabic Literature, is a journalist, essayist and novelist living in exile in Paris. Long banned from publishing in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, she is the author of essays, short stories, and four novels, of which Naphtalene is the most widely acclaimed and translated",Alia Mamdouh,Peter Theroux,The Feminist Press at CUNY,2000,2005,male,Iraq,https://www.feministpress.org/books-n-z/naphtalene,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56d1c90b37013be34dbcc75c/1472831626709-UQYNFIWTV10ZH684315Q/9781558614932-frontcover.jpg?format=1000w,,Coming-of-age story,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340366823l/15716954.jpg,Another translation before,

The Last Chapter,الفصل الأخير,"Charting Aisha's path through adolescence and young adulthood up to the present, her story is told through a series of flashbacks, anecdotes, and glimpses of the past, all bound up with a strong, often strident, always compelling worldview that takes in Morocco, its politics, people, and traditions, Islam, and marriage. Male-female relationships feature strongly in the narrative, and by exposing us to Aisha's troubled romantic encounters, Abouzeid uncovers the shifting male/female roles within the Morocco of her lifetime. Many aspects of Moroccan society are also explored through the other clashes of the modern and the traditional in Aisha's life. The workplace and corruption, the struggle for women's rights, the clash between Islamic and Western values as well as with the older practices of sorcery and witchcraft, and the conflict between colonial and native language use are all intertwined in a narrative that is both forceful and often poetic. Through a series of tales of emotional disasters, the reader becomes aware not only of Aisha's frustrations but also of her deep commitment to her country and her struggle to defeat suffering, uphold justice, and retain a fierce independence as a woman and a clarity of conviction in her life. Leila Abouzeid is a pioneer among her Moroccan contemporaries in that she writes in Arabic rather than in French and is the first Moroccan woman writer of literature to be translated into English.

Blue Aubergine,الباذنجانة الزرقاء,"This novel tells the story of a young Egyptian woman, born in 1967, growing up in the wake of Egypt's defeat of that year, and maturing into womanhood against the social and political upheavals Egypt experienced during the final decades of the 20th century. Physically and emotionally scarred by her parents and the events of her childhood, and incapable of relating to men, Nada, ""Blue Aubergine,"" fumbles through a series of dark and unsettling adventures, resorting first to full Islamic dress with ""niqab"" and gloves, and then throwing it all off for the flowing hair and tight clothes of the emancipated young graduate student, in an ever more desperate and ultimately failed search for tenderness and affection. A frank assessment of the damage society wreaks by foisting unwise claustrophobic values on its children, this text shifts unpredictably through time and space. A mixed crowd of aunts and teachers, classmates and fellow students, Marxists and Islamicists are there to people Blue Aubergine's bewildering journey to the knowledge that the maintenance of chastity and innocence and her determination to cling to the threads of silk and lace that bind her to her past bring only misery and isolation.",Miral al-Tahawy,Anthony Calderbank,American University of Cairo Press,2000,2002,Man,Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387666.Blue_Aubergine,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1174361804l/387666._SY475_.jpg,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1227907017l/5952284.jpg,,

A woman in the crossfire,تقاطع نيران: من يوميات الانتفاضة السورية,"A well-known novelist and journalist from the coastal city of Jableh, Samar Yazbek witnessed the beginning four months of the uprising first-hand and actively participated in a variety of public actions and budding social movements. Throughout this period she kept a diary of personal reflections on, and observations of, this historic time. Because of the outspoken views she published in print and online, Yazbek quickly attracted the attention and fury of the regime, vicious rumours started to spread about her disloyalty to the homeland and the Alawite community to which she belongs. The lyrical narrative describes her struggle to protect herself and her young daughter, even as her activism propels her into a horrifying labyrinth of insecurity after she is forced into living on the run and detained multiple times, excluded from the Alawite community and renounced by her family, her hometown and even her childhood friends. With rare empathy and journalistic prowess Samar Yazbek compiled oral testimonies from ordinary Syrians all over the country. Filled with snapshots of exhilarating hope and horrifying atrocities, she offers us a wholly unique perspective on the Syrian uprising. Hers is a modest yet powerful testament to the strength and commitment of countless unnamed Syrians who have united to fight for their freedom. These diaries will inspire all those who read them, and challenge the world to look anew at the trials and tribulations of the Syrian uprising.",Samar Yazbek,Max Weiss,Haus Publishing,2012,,Man,Syria,https://www.hauspublishing.com/product/a-woman-in-the-crossfire/,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348542016l/13591934.jpg,,Biography,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1336108960l/13633285.jpg,,

Memoirs from the Women’s Prison,مذكراتي في سجن النساء,"In this highly literary, Kafkaesque account, Saadawi, an Egyptian feminist, doctor, activist and author of books on female sexuality, recalls her imprisonment in 1981 for ``attack[ing] the ruling system''. While her case was investigated, Saadawi spent 22 days in jail, getting out when President Sadat was assassinated. In meticulous detail and understated language, she describes nightmarish experiences in a tomb-like women's cell with other political prisoners-both intellectuals and Islamic fundamentalists. She observes, ``Time and the wall have merged into one. The air is motionless. Nothing moves around me except the cockroaches and rats, as I lie on a thin rubber mattress which gives off the odour of old urine, my empty handbag placed under my head.'' There is an honest, reflective quality to her writing, and her plight evokes outrage and sympathy. Yet there is a certain paranoia as well, that of someone on the far left who viewed Islamic extremists as allies in the fight for national unity against a government controlled by foreigners, someone who volunteered to fight with Palestinian guerillas in Jordan and saw herself as being victimized because of her opposition to Sadat's policies of peace with Israel.",Nawal El Saadawi,Marilyn Booth,University of California Press,1982,1994,woman,Egypt,https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-520-08887-0,https://images.ucpress.edu/covers/300/9780520088887.jpg,,,USA,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1425299799l/22614383.jpg,,
"A Mountainous Journey: A Poet’s Autobiography,",رحلة جبلية رحلة صعبة: سيرة ذاتية,"Born in 1917 to the wealthy Palestinian Touqan family known for their accomplishments in many fields, Fadwa was restricted to remaining home at age 13. Her education was taken up by her brother who taught her poetry and encouraged her in becoming a distinguished poet. With the fall of Palestine in 1948, Fadwa's world opens up, allowing her to interact with male and female, colleagues, travel, and become politically aware. By 1967, her poetry had shifted from portraying women's hardships in the Arab world to the difficulties of life under Israeli occupation and she soon devoted herself to Palestinian causes. Her autobiography depicts her journey from a life of madated attire and seclusion to becoming a symbol of the Palestinian cause and ""one of the most distinguished figures of modern Arabic literature.""",Fadwa Tuqan,Olive Kenny,Graywolf Press,1985,1990,woman,Palestine,https://www.worldcat.org/title/mountainous-journey-an-autobiography/oclc/231505564&referer=brief_results,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781555971380-us.jpg,http://d3e1m60ptf1oym.cloudfront.net/391decbc-95ba-43f8-9cb2-e12c841b683e/Scan-130514-0005_xlarge.jpg,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383586987l/18752627.jpg,,

The Wiles of Men and Other Stories,,"Set among the poor of contemporary Cairo, these thirteen stories and one short novella tell of women struggling to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life. They explore the limits of self-awareness, the pressures to conform, and some of the strange paths to escape that women resort to in a conservative society shot through with social and sexual prejudice and preconceptions. Salwa Bakr contends that Arabic literature has been the domain of men and that it is the task of women writing in Arabic to redress the balance. One of Egypt's most interesting women writers of fiction, she is an emerging talent of great power. Her published oeuvre includes three story collections, a novel, and many popular articles. This translation of The Wiles of Men and Other Stories was first published in hardcover by Quartet Books of Great Britain in 1992.",Salwa Bakr,Denys Johnson Davies,University of Texas Press,,1993,man,Egypt,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91RF9w21E2L.jpg,https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/static/images/uploads/0606salwabakr.jpg,fiction,Canada,,,
The Square Moon: Supernatural Tales,القمر المربع,"Marking collisions of culture and character, these ten short stories arise at the frontiers where Arabic tradition melds with both the modern European world and a Gothic strata of the supernatural. The resultant mix sparks tensions between the sexes, between identities, and between experimental forms of storytelling and strict narrative. In Samman's fiction, matchmakers still come to call, but lovers go bungee jumping. A schizophrenic has a discussion with one of his personalities about murder and relationships with women. Avoiding ghosts both real and imagined, a war exile confronts class structure; the art of Paris; and the trials of being a woman, an Arab, and a writer in a country and culture not her own. The spirit of a strangled lover tells the story of his murder and of the web of love, beauty, lust, and loathing that brought about his demise.",Ghada Samman,Issa J.

Code Name: Butterfly,إسمي الحركي فراشة,"With irony and poignant teenage idealism, Butterfly draws us into her world of adult hypocrisy, sibling rivalries, girlfriends' power plays, unrequited love...not to mention the political tension of life under occupation. As she observes her fragile environment with all its conflicts, Butterfly is compelled to question everything around her. Is her father a collaborator for the occupiers? Will Nizar ever give her the sign she's waiting for? How will her friendship with the activist Mays and the airhead Haya survive the unpredictable storms ahead?

The Servant,فاتن,"Faten’s happy life in her village comes to an abrupt end when her father arranges for her to work as a servant for a wealthy Beirut family with two spoiled daughters. What does a bright, ambitious seventeen-year-old do when she is suddenly deprived of her friends, family, education and freedom? Could the mysterious, wealthy young man who lives in the next apartment building help?
 When Faten finally manages to make contact with Marwan, a musician and engineering student, he helps her figure out a way to pursue her studies in secret. Even against the uncertain backdrop of the civil war, their romance develops, as the two conspire to exchange notes and meet at an idyllic seaside cafe. But in Lebanese society the differences in religion, class and wealth are stacked against them, and their parents have very different ideas about what their futures should be. When Marwan’s mother chooses a girl who will make him a suitable wife, Faten must pick up the pieces of her life and move forward. She does so, despite the odds, pursuing a job, an education and her independence.
 And, in the end, it seems there may be room in her life yet for romance, and hope for a future where young people can determine their own destinies.
 An engaging and lucidly written coming-of-age novel. Faten struggles to fulfill her potential in the midst of her society’s rigid expectations. She’s a nuanced, complex protagonist that any teenager can relate to — stubborn, impulsive and full of longing, but with the determination and smarts to keep her real dreams in sight.",Fatima Sharafeddine,Fatima Sharafeddine,Groundwood Books,2010,2013,woman,Lebanon,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IN8OVAG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1289549558l/9681427.jpg,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1268309358p5/1399967.jpg,Young Adult Fiction,Lebanon,,,

Children of the New World,Les Enfants du Nouveau Monde,"Assia Djebar, one of the most distinguished woman writers to emerge from the Arab world, wrote Children of the New World following her own involvement in the Algerian resistance to colonial French rule. Like the classic film The Battle of Algiers—enjoying renewed interest in the face of world events—Djebar’s novel sheds light on current world conflicts as it reveals a determined Arab insurgency against foreign occupation, from the inside out.

However, Djebar focuses on the experiences of women drawn into the politics of resistance. Her novel recounts the interlocking lives of women in a rural Algerian town who find themselves joined in solidarity and empower each other to engage in the fight for independence. Narrating the resistance movement from a variety of perspectives—from those of traditional wives to liberated students to political organizers—Djebar powerfully depicts the circumstances that drive oppressed communities to violence and at the same time movingly reveals the tragic costs of war.
